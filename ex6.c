/*
 * Dynamic memory allocation is useful when we do not know the storage
 * requirements before the program executes.
 *
 * In this exercise, you should create a function that, given a size,
 * allocates an array of integers and returns the address given.
 *
 * The memory should be freed as well! Although the memory will be reclaimed
 * by the OS upon exit, you should develop the habit of freeing memory that was
 * allocated. Free the memory before exiting.
